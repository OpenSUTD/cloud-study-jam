In this introductory-level quest, you will get hands-on practice with the Google Cloud Platform’s fundamental tools and services. GCP Essentials is the recommended first Quest for the Google Cloud learner—you will come in with little or no prior cloud knowledge, and come out with practical experience that you can apply to your first GCP project.

**More information coming soon!**
