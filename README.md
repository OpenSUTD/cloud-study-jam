In this introductory-level quest, you will get hands-on practice with the Google Cloud Platform’s fundamental tools and services. GCP Essentials is the recommended first Quest for the Google Cloud learner—you will come in with little or no prior cloud knowledge, and come out with practical experience that you can apply to your first GCP project:

* Google Cloud Platform Console
* Google Compute Engine
* Google Kubernetes Engine
* Network and Load Balancers

During the workshop, we will be providing you with a promo code that gives you one month free access to all the labs on QwikLabs. **All participants are expected to complete the GCP Essentials quest on QwikLabs within two weeks after the workshop.**
